A continuation of my group project Alloy from ICS 314.  My group and I created Alloy during the Fall semester of 2016 with the hopes of making a website that can initiate or strengthen collaboration for projects that needed team members.  A way to get a person's project exposure.  At the moment Alloy is bound to the University of Hawaii: Manoa student/faculty bodies.
