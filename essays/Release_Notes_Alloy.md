A continuation of my group project Alloy from ICS 314.  My group and I created Alloy during the Fall semester of 2016 with the hopes of making a website that can initiate and strengthen collaboration for projects that needed team members, a way to get a person's project exposure.  At the moment Alloy is bound to the University of Hawaii: Manoa student/faculty bodies.

<h3>Current features of Alloy are the following:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Login information is the username and password associated with a persons UH Manoa login</li>
	<li>Users are able to create projects, which are public to other users to view</li>
	<li>A search function is available for projects and users, which searches based on skills wanted for projects or skills users currently entered into their personal user information</li>
	<li>Users can view individual project profile pages from the search results page</li>
	<li>From project profile pages a user can request to join a project if they are not a member or if they are a project admin, they can send invitations to other users</li>
	<li>When a request to join is sent to one of their projects a notification is sent to the other of the project</li>
	<li>When a user sends an invitation to join a project to another user a notification is sent to the recipient of the invitation</li>
	<li>User's hompeage includes a feed of notifications showing request or invitations</li>
	<li>User's homepage includes a feed of suggested projects which are related to skills a user has entered into their user information, this is possible through a skill-graph function in Alloy which relates certain skills that are added to an individual project, the more times two skills are added to the same project the stronger the relation between the two will become</li>
</ul>

<h3>January 15: Features/Enhancements</h3>
Last semester many of the user feedback were in regards to the Search function/capabilities of Alloy.  A few of the search function remarks I hope to correct in this initial milestone are the following:  users shouldn't have to press "clear" to see new search results with a new query; and having the Search pages only available to users who are logged in.
<ul>
	<li>Reactivity</li>
	<li>Privacy</li>
</ul>
