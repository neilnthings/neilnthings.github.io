<h2>Diving Into JS</h2>

For the past week I've had to start learning Javascript.  I dabbled a little bit with the language before taking ICS 314 but not enough to form a solid opinion.  During the week I had several exercises that helped me build my skills in the language.  I had to complete the basic Javascript section from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) and solving Eulor problems from [Project Eulor](https://projecteuler.net/) by creating and compiling Javascript code in [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).

<h3>What do you think about Javascript so far?</h3>

<h3>If youâ€™re a complete newbie, how does it compare to other programming languages that you know?</h3>

<h3>Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?</h3>

<h2>What about athletic software engineering? Did you find the practice WODs to be useful? What do you think about this style of learning? Is it stressful? Is it enjoyable? Do you think it will work for you?</h2>
