For the past week I've had to start learning Javascript.  I dabbled a little bit with the language before taking ICS 314, thought by Professor Phillip Johnson, but not enough to form a solid opinion.  During the week I had to do several exercises that helped me build my skills in the language.  I had to complete the basic Javascript section from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) and solving Eulor problems from [Project Eulor](https://projecteuler.net/) by creating and compiling Javascript code in [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).

<h4>What do you think about Javascript so far?</h4>

I've found that Javascript is a fun and simple language.  Like C/C++ and Java the basic programming structures are the same.  For example, assignment operators or loops behave the same as the other two languages.  The syntax is very similar as well, I only had to learn a small amount of new syntax, for example, console.log() to print and var 'some variable name' to declare variables.  A difference that I appreciated very much is that Javascript is able to store different variables in the same array.

One thing that I did not like about Javascript is how variables are declared.  Even though variable declaration is the same as C/C++ or Java, the part that I dislike about Javascript variable declaration is that all datatypes can be declared by using either var, let, or const.  By not being able to distinguish the datatype of a variable during declaration I feel that it will bring up problems or increase the complexity of larger, much more complicated projects.

<h4>What about athletic software engineering? What do you think about this style of learning?</h4>

Professor Johnson called the Eulor problems that I had to complete, in [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), WODs.  WOD stands for 'workout of the day' and in regards to ICS 314, are programming exercises that must be completed under a specified time.  Multiple WODs are given throughout the week to help students form the habit of coding under stress, this is athletic software engineering.  I enjoyed that the style of programming, athletic software engineering, brought a sense of competition and made writing code feel like playing a game but I do not think this style would work for me.  I can write code fast but I like taking my time to ensure that my code is efficient and when I am rushed by a time constraint that efficiency is lost.
