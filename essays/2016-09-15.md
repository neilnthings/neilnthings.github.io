Working in teams is an essential skill for any software engineer.  Many jobs and projects a programmer will work on in their career will require some sort of teamwork or collaboration.  Modern programs, such as operating systems or database management software, are so complex that a single person would require years to decades to finish one polished and working application, even if that person is an outstanding coder.  That is the reason teamwork and collaboration is such a necessity for the modern programmer.

<h4>Tools of the Trade</h4>

In recent years there have been programs/software that have been created to help coders better collaborate with other coders on bigger and bigger projects.  Smarter messaging applications like [Slack](https://slack.com/) or [Asana](https://asana.com/), to mention just a few out there, that really helps a team communicate clearly with one another.  There are also great configuration management applications like [Git](https://git-scm.com/), again only mentioning one of many, that help a teams of coders efficiently create a large and complex program.  For a better understanding of what Configuration Management is all about you can read about it in [CMU's site](http://www.sei.cmu.edu/productlines/frame_report/config.man.htm).  Presently cloud-based software hosting platforms are available for teams or individual coders that can hold a vast amount of data/code, the most popular being [Github](http://github.com/).
