summary: A choose-your-own-adventure style web comic.

<img class="ui large image" src="../images/comic3.png">

My team created this choose-your-own-adventure style web comic in ICS 111.  Users can experience different stories by what speech bubble they choose in each page of the application.

</div>

My main responsibility during this project had been implementing the overall code.  I had to write the code to parse text from the script and have it load into their designated comic pages.  I had to ensure that the speech bubble links sent users to the correct comic page when clicked.  I had to create the GUI for the program.  All images were borrowed from [Marvel](http://marvel.com) comics.
